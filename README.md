In this assignment we were tasked with creating a Quiz Game using Javascript.

These were the assignment requirements:
    GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
    WHEN I click the start button
    THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
    WHEN I answer a question
    THEN I am presented with another question
    WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
    THEN time is subtracted from the clock
    WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
    THEN the game is over
    WHEN the game is over
    THEN I can save my initials and my score 
    
This project was a class assignment and therefore is not open for collaboration.

Below is a screenshot of the site.
